# OPF - Open Pet Feeder Project

## What is OPF?

OPF is a project built to make automated pet-feeding easy. It's designed with a RaspberryPi (RPi), the official RPi camera module (PiCam), and a servomoter. The web server has been optimized for both PCs and mobile devices using responsive design. It's based on the [RPi_Cam_Web_Interface](http://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface) project which serves as a great out-of-the-box configuration for setting up an Apache server streaming the PiCam using RaspiMJPEG.
